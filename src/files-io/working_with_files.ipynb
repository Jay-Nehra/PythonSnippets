    "## Types of Files\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of files that python works with: binary files and text files. Most of the files that we generally work with in computers are the binary files. Here are the common examples of the binary files:\n",
    "* Image files jpg, png, bmp, gif etc. \n",
    "* databases files like mdb, frm, sqlite etc.\n",
    "* document files including doc, xls, pdf etc\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be the case that these files say include text but their format is binary files type. The reson for this is requirement for special handling and specific software to work with these. For example you need excel/ libre to work with the excel files or database program to work with sqlite file. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand text files has no special encoding. and can be opened in any standard text editor. text files all have an unseen character at the end of each line which lets the text editor know that there should be a new line. When interacting with these files through programming, you can take advantage of that character. In Python, it is denoted by the “\\n”."

    "You can open the file in many different modes: \n",
    "* 'w' – Write Mode: This mode is used when the file needs to be altered and information changed or added. Keep in mind that this erases the existing file to create a new one. File pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "* 'r' – Read Mode: This mode is used when the information in the file is only meant to be read and not changed inany way. File pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "* 'a' – Append Mode: This mode adds information to the end of the file automatically. File pointer is placed at the end of the file.\n",
    "* 'r+' – Read/Write Mode: This is used when you will be making changes to the file and reading information from it. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "* 'a+' – Append and Read Mode: A file is opened to allow data to be added to the end of the file and lets your program read information as well. File pointer is placed at the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are using binary files, you will use the same mode specifiers. However, you add a b to the end. So a write mode specifier for a binary file is 'wb'. The others are 'rb', 'ab', 'r+b', and 'a+b' respectively."

However, depending on your code, this garbage collection can happen at any time."
