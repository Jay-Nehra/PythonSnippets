# attrs

`attrs` gives us a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class.

After declaring your attributes, attrs gives you:

- a concise and explicit overview of the classâ€™s attributes,
- a nice human-readable __repr__,
- equality-checking methods,
- an initializer,
without writing dull boilerplate code again and again and without runtime performance penalties.
